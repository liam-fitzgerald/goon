      :: The "informational" attributes:
      ::   These explain to the user the meaning of a particular interface 
      ::   element. These simply have attached cords, meaning that all notion
      ::   of 'rich text' is being punted on for the meantime
      ::
      ::   %key: A machine internal identifer, for grouping similar 'kinds' of 
      ::   data
      ::     This is used largely to generate consistent tables 
      [%key p=term]
      ::
      ::  %lede: A headline briefly explaining the use of a particular element. 
      ::    For container elements, this might be what is a "title" in other UI
      ::    systems. For elements that have the %click attribute set, this 
      ::    should be a short explanation of what the button does
      ::
      [%lede p=lede]
      ::  %info: A longer (possibly multi-line) description of the use of a
      ::  particular element. This should enumerate all the possibilities of the
      ::  element, and should be akin to a "help" page in other systems.
      ::
      [%info p=info]
      ::  %value: A $dime representing the a urbit atom to be rendered
      ::
      ::  This is the underlying value being represented by the element. It can
      ::  be used to produce form controls with the %edit attribute, or simply 
      ::  used for data representation
      ::
      [%value p=iota]
      ::  The "interaction" attribute:
      ::    These imply that the element can be interacted with in some way.
      ::    %act and %click are mutually exclusive, reflecting the law of the 
      ::    excluded middle (all elements have either zero, one (%click) or many
      ::    (%act) interactions. Although the datatype does not (and cannot, 
      ::    without loss of generality or an improvement in the type system)
      ::    prevent both of them being set, the rendering engine will simply 
      ::    choose the attribute that it sees first. The paths produced by these
      ::    interactions will be the the path of the element (all elements have
      ::    a uniquely identifying path) concatenated with the path specified in
      ::    the interaction
      ::
      ::  %edit: This a declaration that the %value of this element is editable
      [%edit ~]
      ::
      ::
      ::  %act: A list of interactions for this element
      ::    This is our translation of the much maligned "hamburger menu",
      ::    where a component conceals a variety of interactions. However, given
      ::    the architecture, the rendering engine has a variety of methods to 
      ::    make this more user-friendly. 
      [%act p=(list act)]
      ::  %click: The singular interaction for this element
      ::
      ::    What this element does when 'clicked' (actually activated, given we 
      ::    aren't assuming a mouse and keyboard) should be immediately obvious
      ::    given the attributes on the rest of the element. If p is & then the 
      ::    values of sibling elements with %edit set will be sent with the event
      ::
      ::    NB: this feels like a hacky way to introduce forms? possibly 
      ::    introducing them modally is better??
